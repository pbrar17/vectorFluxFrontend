    <h1>About VectorFlux</h1>
    <p>VectorFlux is a web application designed to visualize vector fields defined by mathematical functions. Users can input their own functions for the x and y components of the vector field, and the application will render a graphical representation of the field.</p>
    
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>When you enter your functions for u(x,y) and v(x,y), the application sends these functions to a serverless backend that processes the request and generates an image of the vector field. The image is then displayed on the page.</p>
    
    <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Input custom mathematical functions for vector fields</li>
        <li>Real-time rendering of vector fields</li>
        <li>Responsive design for various devices</li>
    </ul>
